            Yoshitora Utagawa, <i>America</i>, color woodblock print on paper, 1867
        </div>
        <div class="galleryText" style="margin-top: 2rem;">
            Yoshitora Utagawa’s <i>America</i> sees his depiction of a generic city in the US. Being the eldest student of the famous Utagawa Kuniyoshi, Yoshitora quickly became an esteemed ukiyo-e artist. Yoshitora was renowned for his depictions of Western countries such as France and London, with <i>America</i> being the last print he did in this style. It’s unlikely Yoshitora visited any of the countries he depicted. Yoshitora captures a vivid scene of flying air balloons, people dressed in Victorian-era clothing, and Western-style architecture, reflecting the transformative period in Japan's history. His artwork showcases the influx of new technologies and Western influences that entered Japan following the long period of its isolationist policy.

            Yoshikazu Utagawa, <i>Foreigners Having a Party at the Gankirō Tea House in Miyozki, Yokohama</i>, color woodblock print on paper, 1861
        </div>
        <div class="galleryText" style="margin-top: 2rem;">
            The end of Japan’s isolationist period brought cultures into contact that had never interacted before, often resulting in clashes. Yoshikazu's <i>Foreigners Having a Party at the Gankirō Tea House in Miyozki, Yokohama</i> vividly captures the tensions that arose from these cultural differences. The artwork portrays a group of foreigners hosting a lively party at a tea house, juxtaposed with the varied reactions of the Japanese locals. At the time Japanese opinions on foreign people were varied, with some being more accepting than others. This dynamic is illustrated through contrasting scenes in the piece with depictions of musicians glaring at the foreigners as well as a Japanese women embracing a foreigner.

            Sadahide Utagawa, <i>Sales Room at a Foreign Trading House in Yokohama</i>, color woodblock print on paper, 1861
        </div>
        <div class="galleryText" style="margin-top: 2rem;">
            Yokohama was one of the biggest cultural centers in Japan, and quickly became a hub of trade and business following the opening of Japan. Many Japanese woodblock artists would find inspiration in the lovely, foreign full city of Yokohama, birthing the Yokohame-e woodblock style. Sadahide was one of the most popular Yokohame-e artists, partly due to his tendency to portray foreigners in a positive light. This led to his art becoming heavily desired by foreign merchants, skyrocketing his popularity outside of Japan. <i>Sales Room at a Foreign Trading House in Yokohama</i> portrays a bustling business center filled with Japanese and foreigners alike. Sadahide's piece highlights industries central to Japan's foreign trade, such as textiles and textbooks. His portrayal emphasizes a sense of unity between the Japanese and foreigners, a signature element of his distinctive style of Yokohame-e.
