            Utagawa Yoshitora was an 1850s Japanese artist, who focused on woodblock prints. He was a pupil of Utagawa Kuniyoshi who was revered for his style of prints called Yokohama-e, which saw foreigners as the art's subject. This style of woodblocks gained prominence after Japan's forceful opening in 1860. Yoshitora often tried to replicate scenes from foreign countries, with America as an example.
